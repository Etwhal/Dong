This is just a simple Pong created using Godot, to help me getting back into gamedev.
The game is open-source and under no license, meaning you can do whatever you want with it even monetized it idc.
If you just want to play the game, head to "Release" to download the exe file, otherwise you can download the entire
project and just re-build it if you have Godot on your computer.
